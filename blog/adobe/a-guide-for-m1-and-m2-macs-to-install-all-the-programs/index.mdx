After all I’ve read at this subreddit and my own tries only partly succeeded I decided to write this guide to help you guys with what worked for me. This works for M1 & M2 chips on latest Monterey update. If you run into any problem, let me know in the comments!

If you want the guide as a video, I actually created one. Watch

Download the Creative Cloud App and install it Download

Login with a CC Account. If you dont have one, create one and login afterwards

After you reached the homepage, go into settings and disable auto-updates for the apps and the launcher itself

Close the launcher completely

Go to cmacked’s website and download the apps you want.

Open the .dmg file of the program you want to install

You see various options to choose from -> Click on AntiCC first and install it

After that, go back and open the .dmg file of the app

Here you see the installer (white icon with adobe Icon upside down) -> double click it, if it doesn’t work, right click and click „open“ (We’re going to let MacOS install Rosetta, so internet access is required!)

It will ask you to install Rosetta in order to open the program. Click accept and let it install (internet access is mandatory)

You now did the setup of the requirements to install any programs. Future installations start from here, since you only need to install AntiCC once!

11. You can now right-click then “Show package contents”. Navigate to Contents > MacOS and right click open the “install” file. The installer should now open without a problem.

12. Enter your password and let it install in the default directory

13. Go back to the start where you find the patch (.pgk) file

14. Right-click open it and let it install after entering the password

15. And that’s it. The software is now activated and can be used

16. If a pop-up appears prompting you to insert your password to access KEYCHAIN ACCESS THEN CLICK “DENY” to make it stop showing the pop up keep reading the “Fix Pop-Up Problem” section of this guide

FIX POP-UP PROBLEM

17. Go to the “Keychain Access” app and under the tab “Login” (left side) search for ”Adobe” in the top right corner

18. Now delete every yellow “sticky note-like” entries

ADDITIONALLY

If Premiere (2022) crashes if you want to start it, run this command in the Terminal app:

sudo codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/Adobe\ Premiere\ Pro\ 2022/Adobe\ Premiere\ Pro\ 2022.app

Thanks u/shiftym21 for letting me know!

2. If the installer says “It is damaged and needs to get downloaded again”, run this command in the Terminal app:

sudo spctl —master-disable

Thank you u/Jumpy-Ad1813 for letting me know!

NOTES

Like I said I don’t recommend opening the CC Launcher ever again but apparently you can do it to for example install fonts or Camera RAW for Photoshop. Do it at your own risk!
